Learned that I can create a movie with a series of png files with a script from Brendan. Directory for this is in `/gpfs/projects/CalderGroup/BrendanSpace/movie.sh`. To run it: `bash movie.sh output_movie.mp4 <fps> path/to/images/*.png` where `<fps>` is frames per second, `bash movie.sh` is calling the script to run, `output_movie.mp4` is the name of the output video, and `path/to/images/*.png` is a directory with all of the png's to put in the movie.\n",
    "- Alan gave me the original paper published about FLASH. Will need to read that. He went on to explain things about FLASH and how it runs/makes calculations. It basically breaks a grid down into 'refinements' in which the flux is calculated between them using the 'Reimann Problem'. Will need to read paper to learn further about this."

I've tried then moving onto just doing FORTRAN problems but that doesn't work either because I can't get a compiler on this laptop without admin privledges. I then try to add Python on to this laptop and that doesn't work either, not sure why but I think it again has something to do with admin privleges. Plan on just going into IACS to do whatever I need for the rest of the day. Pretty ridiculous that I have to keep dealing with stuff like this. \n",
