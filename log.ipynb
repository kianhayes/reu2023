To run it: `bash movie.sh output_movie.mp4 <fps> path/to/images/*.png` where `<fps>` is frames per second, `bash movie.sh` is calling the script to run, `output_movie.mp4` is the name of the output video, and `path/to/images/*.png` is a directory with all of the png's to put in the movie.\n",

It basically breaks a grid down into 'refinements' in which the flux is calculated between them using the 'Reimann Problem'. Will need to read paper to learn further about this."

I tried just `./flash4' and that seemed to run the simulation fine but I'm afraid this will take a long time without the MPI. I need to figure out if I need to use the updated modules of MPI, GCC, HDF5 etc. because the flash4.exe I compiled first doesn't have these updated modules. At least now I know it works. I'm just going to let it run this for now and see what it outputs. It seems to be working and making calculations. \n",

    "- After messing with the `flash.par` file, I found that you can change the time between when FLASH outputs a plt file. You have to change the variable called `plotFileIntervalStep`. Specifically, this changes the amount of time steps between the output of plt file. I set this to 1 and it outputs a plt file every single time step. Useful if you want to get a good looking animation with a ton of different images. I'd like to transition to see if I can get this to give me an image at a good FPS to make a nice smooth movie of the Sedov explosion. "

    "- Meeting with Alan:\n",
    "    - First talked about how the time stepping works in fluid dynamic simulations and the importance of time step. Basically, if your time step is too big and tracked data flows outside of the box immediately next to the original then the process crashes. This can be parameterized by the CFL which is a constant involved with the calculation of the next time step to make sure things don't get out of hand. A CFL > 1 is not allowed. Setting the CFL smaller results in small time steps. The opposite is true if CFL is larger. \n",
    "    - We then moved on to talking with Catherine about running a sbatch script in which she showed me the certain parameters that needed to be changed in order to submit a job. \n",
    "    - She also outlined different parameters that can be changed in both the flash.par file and the the setup bash script regrading the amount of blocks. Basically, when the setup is ran, the max blocks is looked at and that amount of blocks is ALLOCATED to each core. Even if they aren't used entirely. So when the simulation is initialized there are 5000 blocks / core. 28 * 5000 adds up to a lot of blocks that aren't even being used. If you want to know an efficient amount to use we can look at the log file which tells the amount of blocks made by the simulation. This is often a lot smaller than 5000. This is why we often run into a problem when adding too many processes when the mpiexec command is ran. There is a memory overload and the program crashes. \n",

To do this, in the top right corner click `File` then `Add Folder to Workspace`. Select the directory you want from Seawulf.\n",
