Learned that I can create a movie with a series of png files with a script from Brendan. Directory for this is in `/gpfs/projects/CalderGroup/BrendanSpace/movie.sh`. To run it: `bash movie.sh output_movie.mp4 <fps> path/to/images/*.png` where `<fps>` is frames per second, `bash movie.sh` is calling the script to run, `output_movie.mp4` is the name of the output video, and `path/to/images/*.png` is a directory with all of the png's to put in the movie.\n",
    "- Alan gave me the original paper published about FLASH. Will need to read that. He went on to explain things about FLASH and how it runs/makes calculations. It basically breaks a grid down into 'refinements' in which the flux is calculated between them using the 'Reimann Problem'. Will need to read paper to learn further about this."

    "- I was able to run FLASH on the 28 core node but it seems that the MPI wasn't able to run when I executed it with the flash4 file. I tried just `./flash4' and that seemed to run the simulation fine but I'm afraid this will take a long time without the MPI. I need to figure out if I need to use the updated modules of MPI, GCC, HDF5 etc. because the flash4.exe I compiled first doesn't have these updated modules. At least now I know it works. I'm just going to let it run this for now and see what it outputs. It seems to be working and making calculations. \n",

    "- I was wondering how to change the amount of time steps it calculates and this can be found in the `flash.par` file in the variable `nend` or `tmax`. I think which ever comes first the simulation will stop on that. \n",
    "- After messing with the `flash.par` file, I found that you can change the time between when FLASH outputs a plt file. You have to change the variable called `plotFileIntervalStep`. Specifically, this changes the amount of time steps between the output of plt file. I set this to 1 and it outputs a plt file every single time step. Useful if you want to get a good looking animation with a ton of different images. I'd like to transition to see if I can get this to give me an image at a good FPS to make a nice smooth movie of the Sedov explosion. "
