Learned that I can create a movie with a series of png files with a script from Brendan. Directory for this is in `/gpfs/projects/CalderGroup/BrendanSpace/movie.sh`. To run it: `bash movie.sh output_movie.mp4 <fps> path/to/images/*.png` where `<fps>` is frames per second, `bash movie.sh` is calling the script to run, `output_movie.mp4` is the name of the output video, and `path/to/images/*.png` is a directory with all of the png's to put in the movie.\n",
    "- Alan gave me the original paper published about FLASH. Will need to read that. He went on to explain things about FLASH and how it runs/makes calculations. It basically breaks a grid down into 'refinements' in which the flux is calculated between them using the 'Reimann Problem'. Will need to read paper to learn further about this."

I've tried then moving onto just doing FORTRAN problems but that doesn't work either because I can't get a compiler on this laptop without admin privledges. I then try to add Python on to this laptop and that doesn't work either, not sure why but I think it again has something to do with admin privleges. Plan on just going into IACS to do whatever I need for the rest of the day. Pretty ridiculous that I have to keep dealing with stuff like this. \n",

    "- I was able to run FLASH on the 28 core node but it seems that the MPI wasn't able to run when I executed it with the flash4 file. I tried just `./flash4' and that seemed to run the simulation fine but I'm afraid this will take a long time without the MPI. I need to figure out if I need to use the updated modules of MPI, GCC, HDF5 etc. because the flash4.exe I compiled first doesn't have these updated modules. At least now I know it works. I'm just going to let it run this for now and see what it outputs. It seems to be working and making calculations. \n",
    "- I just stopped it because I think it was going to take too long to run the simulation. I'm gonna try updating the used modules to see if I can get multithreading. \n",
    "- Okay just recompiled and ran it using MPI and it seems to be working and certainly running faster. Just have to wait a couple seconds for it to hang for a bit after returning the `mpiexec` command.\n",
    "- Nothing special needed to be done in order to run this. It just has to be on the 28 core node. Although, it seems that this node doesn't have the updated modules. So just stick with this until we figure out something for the milan nodes.\n",
    "- I was wondering how to change the amount of time steps it calculates and this can be found in the `flash.par` file in the variable `nend` or `tmax`. I think which ever comes first the simulation will stop on that. \n",
    "- After messing with the `flash.par` file, I found that you can change the time between when FLASH outputs a plt file. You have to change the variable called `plotFileIntervalStep`. Specifically, this changes the amount of time steps between the output of plt file. I set this to 1 and it outputs a plt file every single time step. Useful if you want to get a good looking animation with a ton of different images. I'd like to transition to see if I can get this to give me an image at a good FPS to make a nice smooth movie of the Sedov explosion. "
